# File Organizer - README

## Description
The File Organiser is a Python script designed to help you automatically organize files in your "Downloads" folder into specific subfolders based on their file types. This can help keep your Downloads folder clean and organized, making it easier to find files and reduce clutter.

## How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Download the "File Organiser" script from GitHub URL.
Open the script in a Python editor or run it directly from the command line.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x or later

## Installation
Download the script from the GitHub repository or copy the script code to a new Python file.
Save the file with an appropriate name, for example, "file_organiser.py".

## Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the "file_organiser.py" script is located.
Run the script by typing: python file_organiser.py

## Folder Structure
The File Organiser script creates the following subfolders within your "Downloads" folder:
Images: This folder contains image files with extensions .jpg, .png, and .jpeg.
Videos: This folder contains video files with extensions .mov, .mp4, and .avi.
Docs: This folder contains document files with extensions .pdf, .doc, .pptx, and .xlsx.
Other: This folder contains any other file types that don't fit into the above categories.

## Note
The script will only move files that are not already present in their respective destination folders. If a file with the same name already exists in one of the folders, the script will skip moving that particular file.
It is recommended to run the script periodically or as needed to keep your Downloads folder organized.
